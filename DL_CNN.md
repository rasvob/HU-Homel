# CNN Project Information [🠔](https://homel.vsb.cz/~svo0175/)
* You can get **10 to 20** points

* 📒 Every project must include brief description of the dataset so you get to know the data you are working with
  * Number of images, number of classes and class balance information
    * Take a look at the examples of the images before you begin with any models 🙂

* 🔎 What model performance metrics have you decided to use?
  * e.g. Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score etc.
  * 📒 State which one of the scores is the most important from your point of view given the class balance, task, ... in a Markdown cell!

* 🎯 Try minimally 2 different models
    * 🚀 The first model should be built from scratch, i.e. create your own architecture and train the model
      * If you perform various experiments or hyper-parameter tuning make sure to include everyting in the Notebook step by step with some brief comments about the experiments 
        * 💡 e.g. effect of BatchNormalization, layer sizes or optimizer choice on accuracy, train time, ...
    * 🚀 The second model will use transfer learning techniques
      * You can try any model you wish, e.g. ResNet50, Inception, MobileNet, etc.
        * Take a look at [this list](https://keras.io/api/applications/) and try at least one of them
      * 📌 Fine tune the model for your dataset and compare it with the model that you have created from scratch


## General Information
**✅ Mandatory part of every project is a summary at the end in which you summarize the most interesting insight obtained**.
  
Upload a **📝 Jupyter Notebook with descriptions included** or a PDF report + source codes.

💡 Estimated time for the project is 5-10h, this value heavily depends on your skill, but you can use it as a guidance for a project size.

> #### **🎯 Deadline is 20. 4. 2025 🍀**
  
**Upload the project to:**

* Dropbox:
  * Mon, 09:00: [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/request/zFK6zI8cqsfWyenbzjrf)
  * Wed, 14:15: [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/request/zD7tdnOLIsFxx1NxTtyr)

* **💡 Dropbox will ask you for your name - use your VSB login please 👍**
  
# Example datasets
## 1 - Images of LEGO Bricks
[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joosthazelzet/lego-brick-images](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joosthazelzet/lego-brick-images)

> There are 2 version of the dataset, v1 (LEGO brick images v1 folder) and v2 (dataset folder) - choose only one of the datasets
> 
> You can also subsample only a subset of the dataset to speed up the training as there are many images 🙂

## 2 - Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia)

## 3 - GTSRB - German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark
[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/meowmeowmeowmeowmeow/gtsrb-german-traffic-sign](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/meowmeowmeowmeowmeow/gtsrb-german-traffic-sign)

> Use **ClassId** column as image class

## 4 - LEGO Minifigures

## Dataset of individual selection
>  *It is highly welcomed if you use a dataset of your individual choice. In this case just drop me an e-mail so I can approve your choice or give some recommendations.*
> 
>  *You can find plenty of datasets on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)*

> **If you work with CNN in your semestral project, it is possible to use it instead of this project, even if is not a classification task. Just drop me an e-mail and we will discuss it individually.**
