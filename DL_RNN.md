# RNN Project Information [🠔](https://homel.vsb.cz/~svo0175/)
* You can get **10 to 20** points

* 📒 Every project must include brief description of the dataset so you get to know the data you are working with
  * Number of instances, number of classes and class balance information
  * Examples of the text data

* 🔎 What model performance metrics have you decided to use?
  * e.g. Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score etc.
  * 📒 State which one of the scores is the most important from your point of view given the class balance, task, ... in a Markdown cell!

* 🎯 Try minimally 2 different models
    * 🚀 The first model should be built from scratch, i.e. create your own architecture and train the model
      * If you perform various experiments or hyper-parameter tuning make sure to include everyting in the Notebook step by step with some brief comments about the experiments 
        * 💡 e.g. effect of BatchNormalization,layer sizes or optimizer choice on accuracy,train time, ...
    * 🚀 The second model will use transfer learning techniques
      * You can use any set of pre-trained embedding vectors (GloVe, Word2Vec, FastText etc.) or any transformer-based model (this is optional as it is more advanced approach, see [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/models?pipeline_tag=text-classification&sort=trending) or [Keras NLP models](https://keras.io/api/keras_nlp/models/))
      * 📌 Fine tune the model for your dataset (if it is possible) and compare it with the models that you created from scratch

## General Information
**✅ Mandatory part of every project is a summary at the end in which you summarize the most interesting insight obtained**.
  
Upload a **📝 Jupyter Notebook with descriptions included** or a PDF report + source codes.

💡 Estimated time for the project is 5-10h, this value heavily depends on your skill, but you can use it as a guidance for a project size.

> #### **🎯 Deadline is 26. 5. 2024 🍀**
  
**Upload the project to:**

* Dropbox:
  * Thu, 09:00: [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/request/3QCQnymp2gJeAy0ILqLW)
  * Thu, 12:30: [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/request/6f8aeC6AewMQHveCBCWX)

* **💡 Dropbox will ask you for your name - use your VSB login please 👍**
  
# Example datasets
## 1 - Sentiment140 dataset with 1.6 million tweets
[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kazanova/sentiment140](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kazanova/sentiment140)

> You can select smaller subset of the dataset as it contains pretty high number of tweets.

## 2 - News Category Dataset
[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rmisra/news-category-dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rmisra/news-category-dataset)

## 3 - Coronavirus tweets NLP - Text Classification
[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datatattle/covid-19-nlp-text-classification](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datatattle/covid-19-nlp-text-classification)

## 4 - Trip Advisor Hotel Reviews

## Dataset of individual selection
>  *It is highly welcomed if you use a dataset of your individual choice. In this case just drop me an e-mail so I can approve your choice or give some recommendations.*
> 
>  *You can find plenty of datasets on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)*

> **If you work with RNN in your semestral project, it is possible to use it instead of this project, even if is not a classification task. Just drop me an e-mail and we will discuss it individually.**
